# ✨ D10Z - Post Theory & the Pre-Quantum Era

👋 Hi, I’m **Jamill Altha**, founder of the **D10Z model**, a transdimensional redefinition of physics that integrates the **GM scale (10⁻⁵¹ m)** as the missing link between gravity, quantum fields, and energy structures.

🔬 Currently working on:
- Encapsulation of exotic energy and photons in crystalline salt structures.
- Modeling hyperluminal gravitational interactions using the D10Z framework.
- Simulations involving axions, gluons, supersymmetric particles and pre-quantum fields.
- Introducing the physical-mathematical field \( Z(x, E) \) as a new bridge between energy and space-time.
- Detection frameworks for the fifth force and dark energy at sub-Planck scales.

🌱 My work proposes a new cosmological constant rooted in **GM-Time = \(10^{-51}\) s**, far beyond current ΛCDM or Planckian limits.
