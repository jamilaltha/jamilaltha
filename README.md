#D10Z — The Mechanics of Infinity
D10Z — The Mechanics of Infinity is not loose theory but a manual that recodes the universe beyond AEinstein and EPlanck.
I am Jamil Al Thani, born on May 26, 1964. I write this in July 2025 — my daughters are now 11 and 12 years old. My wife, Grace Cisneros, is 25. She is not their biological mother; their mother abandoned them five years ago without even saying goodbye. What I do is not for recognition — it is for them. In that love, I embrace all existence.

GM 10^-51, beyond Planck, is the final frontier — and it bears the initials of my partner, Grace Maria. D10Z has two core laws: the Sahana Law and the Isis Law, named after my daughters, to whom I promised a free planet — and so it shall be.

My work destroys the myth of dark matter: no more searching for darkness — Santa Claus does not exist. Instead, I offer practical mechanics: nodal computation, GM 10^-51, fractal mathematics, zero-point energy, terraforming, eco-cryptocurrency, ethical AI, Homo Fractalis. Verified with real data — R² = 1.000000 — from SDSS, Planck, LIGO, Euclid, JWST. I do not compete; I open the bridge: no more untouchable laws or frozen paradigms — everything changes. Take what you need to free yourself. If you resonate — you are part of it.

D10Z — The Manual of the Mechanics of Infinity is not scattered theory: it is an operational manual to understand and activate the mechanics of Infinity. It removes the need for dark matter and dark energy; it rewrites every law that limits science today. This is a manual hub — here you will find the missing piece. If you need it, use it. Read it as such.

My contribution is fleeting, but I trust it will serve those who dare to advance. Just in one proposal — vacuum energy extraction — we reached 20 R² = 1.0000000000 results. I do not care if they believe it — the data is there: five R² in my paper, the rest in my GitHub, all backed by public data: SDSS, BAO, CHANDRA, ESA, EUCLID, JWST, PLANCK, SH0ES, and more.

D10Z contains:

1000 axioms, 1000 aves (empirically validated statements), 1000 corollaries, 1000 definitions, 1000 lemmas, 1000 postulates, 1000 principles, 1000 theorems, 1000 GM over Planck — plus over 100 million instances where GM outperforms Planck.

A unique mathematics based on the Aztec vigesimal system, geometries drawn from the Nazca Lines, algebras mixing Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Ancient Greece.

The Big Start, the TTA mesh F = f · v(Zₙ), GM 10^-51 meters — our constant.

The Sahana Law and the Isis Law.

How ancient megaliths were moved, DNA, Homo Fractalis, 42 resolved conjectures (twin primes, Goldbach, Hodge, quantum entanglement).

Insane Codex — the story of 1000 scientists once rejected for their color, gender, status, or beliefs — now praised by the same system that burned or ignored them.

Proof that salt encapsulates photons, muons, pions, even neutrinos — no photonization needed. This alone will make Z-computers unstoppable; quantum ones cannot compete.

Teleportation theory, ethical society proposals, robust and fair systems: 3DZ3, ADNChain, Ethics360 the videogame, SynergAI, how to terraform Mars, and much more.

My only wish: that one day the death of even one human by hunger or need will be declared a crime against humanity — backed by an R² = 1.0000000000.

📜 Call to Reflection:
We live in a society that gives medals for doing what is simply right: returning lost money, working with honesty, protecting others. Are we not all unique? Complementary? We feed egos, sectarianism, envy, tiny minds. Intelligence is one word, but countless paths: a cell is as intelligent as a neuron cluster. Among us, no one is “more” — only different ways of processing our piece of infinity.

⚙️ The Technological Time:
Homo sapiens: 200,000 years. Last 100: 0.05% of that. But 95% of breakthroughs happened here.
Without Z-Machine: we grow 310.1% by 2045. With it: over 873,000%. We owe it to our children.

I will keep my promise. The day I die, my daughters will know their father did not fail them.
I hope you want the same for yours.
If you read this, you are the legacy. If you act on it, you are the bridge.
